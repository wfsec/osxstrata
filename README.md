# osxstrata
* This project is not being actively maintined and will probably stay that way, as we have all moved on from the company that we built this for * 
OS X Strata builds upon Yelps OSXCollector(http://yelp.github.io/osxcollector/), providing a user interface to analyze data collected from a potentially compromised system.

Currently there are two ways that you can run OSXStrata. 

1. Run from the git directory. - Quick and easy.
2. Run as an application.

We are working on a thrid option a docker container. We hope to have that done in the next couple of weeks. 

This probably goes without saying but this app should only be used internally.

Pre Installation Checklist
1. Xcode is needed if you plan to use git to clone the project code. <-OS X only obviously.

2. pip (package manger) needs to be installed.
~~~shell
sudo easy_install pip
~~~
3. Install required python modules
~~~shell
sudo pip install pymongo (2.8 required)
~~~
~~~shell
sudo pip install requests 
~~~
~~~shell
sudo pip install simplejson
~~~
~~~shell
Install Meteor
	-> curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh
~~~

### 1. Running from the git directory.

OS X & Linux
~~~shell	
git clone <insert git repo>
~~~
~~~shell
export PATH_TO_SCRIPTS=<path> MONGO_CONNECT=mongodb://localhost:3001/
~~~
~~~shell
meteor run
~~~

### 2. Run as an application.

OS X
BUILD APP Option 1:
Ensure pre-installation checklist is done.
~~~shell
meteor build osxstrata
cd osxstrata
mv osxstrata.tar.gz ~/dirctoryofchoice
tar -xvf osxstrata.tar.gz
~~~
The uncompressed file should create a directory called bundle. 

Build APP Option 2:
Instead of creating the tar file you can download it from the git repo.

~~~shell
tar -xvf osxstrata.tar.gz
~~~
The uncompressed file should create a directory called bundle.
